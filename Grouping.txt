Question 1. find average age of all users 

when you specify _id: null within a $group stage, it means that you want to aggregate all documents 
into a single group, ignoring any specific field values. This effectively treats all documents as 
part of the same group, regardless of their values.

[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      averageAge: {
        $avg: "$age",
      },
    },
  },
]

Question 2. find average age of male and females

[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$gender",
      averageAge: {
        $avg: "$age",
      },
    },
  },
] 

Question 3. list of top 2 favorite fruits among all users

count: { $sum: 1 }: This line instructs MongoDB to create a new field called "count" for each group 
and use the $sum operator to increment the count by 1 for each document in the group. 
$sum: 1: increase count by 1 for each document in the group. 
if $sum: 2: increase count by 2 for each document in the group.

$sort: {
      count: -1,
    }

count is field we get after 1st stage.
-1: for ascending order
1: for descending order

[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$favoriteFruit",
      count: {
        $sum: 1,               
      },
    },
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      count: -1,
    },
  },
  {
    $limit: 2,
  },
]
